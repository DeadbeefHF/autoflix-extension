# AutoFlix extension

This extension is used by [AutoFlix](https://autoflix.deadbeef.me) in order to
inject custom javascript into the pages served by Netflix.

This repository is given for clarification/educational purposes. The code is
clean and very simple. All the logic of the product happens on the server-side,
which means that there's not much to learn from reading the source code.
